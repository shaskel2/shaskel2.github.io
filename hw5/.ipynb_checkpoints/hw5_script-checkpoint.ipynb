    "This visualization explores how reported Bigfoot sightings vary across seasons and years. Each point represents the number of reports in a given season during a specific year, showing both temporal and seasonal variation within the dataset. The x-axis encodes year as an ordinal variable to show the passage of time, while the y-axis encodes the count of reports as a quantitative measure. Before plotting, I aggregated the dataset by year and season using groupby operations in pandas to count the number of reports in each category.\n",

This selection mechanism, implemented with selection_point() in Altair, lets the viewer isolate a specific season and observe how reporting trends change over time. The interactivity enhances both clarity and engagement, helping identify whether reports spike in particular seasons (for example, a consistent rise in summer) without the distraction of overlapping points. This design choice encourages exploratory analysis while maintaining a clean, easily interpretable layout."

    "This bar chart highlights the ten U.S. states with the most reported Bigfoot sightings. I aggregated the dataset by state and sorted it in descending order by the number of reports, keeping only the top ten entries for readability. The x-axis represents the total count of reports, while the y-axis lists the corresponding states. I used a quantitative color encoding with a warm orange scale to emphasize magnitude, helping the viewer quickly identify which states lead in sightings. This color scheme was chosen to provide contrast from the first map visualization while maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. Unlike the first visualization, this one is static—it focuses on clarity and ranking rather than exploration. The simplicity of the design makes it easy to compare the frequency of reports between states at a glance."
